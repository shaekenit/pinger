# Pinger - *how to use*

Pinger is a lightweight tool that lets your friends know when you’re online.

When you start your device, the **Pinger client** launches automatically and connects to your chosen server.
All ping requests sent while you were offline are stored in a server-side queue, so you’ll receive them as soon as you come online.

To get started, open the **system tray menu** and enter your server URL in the **Server URL** text field — this tells Pinger where to send and receive your pings.
Once that’s set, everything runs automatically in the background — no further setup needed.
